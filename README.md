# checkra1n_updater
A simple script to check for checkra1n updates and download them.

I recommend putting this in its own folder. That way the files it downloads won't clutter your beautiful home folder.

To install the required dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you cloned the project, or `pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml` if you chose the curl way.

Either download it and run `python3 launcher.py` or run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flash76/checkra1n_updater/master/launcher.py | python3` to just run it once without downloading it.
